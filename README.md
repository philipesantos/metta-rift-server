# MeTTa Rift – Server

> **Note:** This repository contains the server for MeTTa Rift. If you're looking for the client, visit [MeTTa Rift – Client](https://github.com/fluidity-labs/metta-rift-client).

**MeTTa Rift** is a fun and educational text-based RPG that showcases the power of [OpenCog Hyperon](https://hyperon.opencog.org/) and the [MeTTa language](https://metta-lang.dev/). It features a procedurally generated world with advanced reasoning and memory management capabilities. Designed to foster community adoption and engagement, MeTTa Rift serves as an interactive way to explore and expand the utility of MeTTa while immersing players in a dynamic AI-driven experience.

The game includes a built-in console where players can observe all actions taken by MeTTa during gameplay, providing transparency into its decision-making and reasoning process. Additionally, an admin mode allows any query or action to be performed, offering deeper exploration and experimentation with MeTTa’s full capabilities.

## Features

- 🌍 **Procedural Generation** – The game world is dynamically created based on AI-driven rules.
- 🧠 **Advanced Reasoning** – Powered by OpenCog Hyperon for intelligent decision-making.
- 📜 **Memory Management** – NPCs and the environment retain and adapt to past interactions.
- 🎮 **Text-Based Adventure** – A rich, interactive experience where players navigate and shape the world through text commands.
- 🖥️ **Action Console** – Players can view all actions taken by MeTTa during gameplay, providing insight into its reasoning process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**  
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **Linux/macOS** (Hyperon is currently not available on Windows)
- [**MeTTa Rift – Client**](https://github.com/fluidity-labs/metta-rift-client)

### Installation

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fluidity-labs/metta-rift-server.git
cd metta-rift-server

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run in CLI mode
python main.py

# Run in websocket mode
METTA_RIFT_INPUT_MODE=websocket python main.py
```

## Input Modes

Choose the active input transport at startup with `METTA_RIFT_INPUT_MODE`:

- `cli` (default): reads commands from stdin.
- `websocket`: starts a websocket server and accepts commands from a web client.

Optional websocket settings:

- `METTA_RIFT_WEBSOCKET_HOST` defaults to `127.0.0.1`
- `METTA_RIFT_WEBSOCKET_PORT` defaults to `8765`

## Websocket Messages

When `METTA_RIFT_INPUT_MODE=websocket`, the server accepts JSON messages only.

Request:

```json
{
  "command": "look around",
  "command_type": "natural_language"
}
```

Supported `command_type` values:

- `natural_language`
- `metta`

Examples:

```json
{
  "command": "pick up lantern",
  "command_type": "natural_language"
}
```

```json
{
  "command": "!(move player north)",
  "command_type": "metta"
}
```

Startup event:

```json
{
  "event": "startup"
}
```

If the startup trigger produces messages, they are sent immediately after the `startup`
event as a normal `command_result`:

```json
{
  "event": "command_result",
  "queries": [
    {
      "command_type": "metta",
      "original_input": "!(trigger (Startup))",
      "matched_metta": "!(trigger (Startup))",
      "original_responses": [
        "(Response 100 \"You are in a cabin.\")"
      ],
      "responses": [
        "You are in a cabin."
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Command response:

```json
{
  "event": "command_result",
  "queries": [
    {
      "command_type": "natural_language",
      "original_input": "look around",
      "matched_metta": "!look",
      "original_responses": [
        "(Response 5 \"You are in a cabin.\")"
      ],
      "responses": [
        "You are in a cabin."
      ]
    },
    {
      "command_type": "metta",
      "original_input": "!(synchronize-tick)",
      "matched_metta": "!(synchronize-tick)",
      "original_responses": [],
      "responses": []
    }
  ]
}
```

Error event:

```json
{
  "event": "error",
  "error": "..."
}
```

Game won event:

```json
{
  "event": "game_won"
}
```

Game over event:

```json
{
  "event": "game_over"
}
```
